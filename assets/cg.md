    > first to use command and control CRT displays console on which
    > operators identified targets with the light pens.

-   The beginning of modern interactive graphics, however were found in
    IVAN SUTHER LAND'S seminal doctoral work on the sketchpad drawing
    systems. He introduced data structures for storing symbol
    hierarchies built up via replication of standard components ( used
    for drawing circuit symbols). He also developed interaction
    technique that use the keyboard ad light pen for making choices,
    pointing and drawing and formulating many other ides and technique
    still in use today.

-   By the mid- sixties, a number of research projects and commercial
    products had appeared as the potentially of CAD activities in
    computer, automobile and aerospace grew enormously for automating
    drafting-insensitive activities. The general motor system for
    automobile design and Intek Digitek system for lens design were
    pioneers in showing the efforts utilizing graphics interaction in
    the interactive cycles common in engineering.

-   Due to the high cost of graphics hardware , expensive computing
    resources, difficulty in wring large interactive program and due to
    many other reasons the human-computer interaction was still done
    primarily in both mode using punched cards. After the advent of
    graphics based personal computers such as Apple Macintosh and IBM
    PC, the costs of both hardware and software droven down. Millions of
    graphics computer were sold exclusively for offices and home. Thus
    the interactive graphics (GUI) as "the window on the computer"
    became an integral part of PC featuring graphical interaction.

> flicker in the system. Before this, buffer memory and processors were
> enough only to refresh at 30HZ and only few thousand lines could be
> drawn without noticeable flicker.

-   Another major hardware advance of late sixties was attaching a
    > display is a minicomputer, relieving heavy

> and updating image on the screen) with the central-time sharing

-   In 1968, another such devices was invented. The refresh display

-   The development of inexpensive raster graphics, based on television
    > technology in early seventies contributed more to the growth of
    > the field. The Raster displays stores displays stores display
    > primitives (lines, characters or

> areas) in a refresh buffer.

The development of graphics cannot be stand-off without the study of
graphics input technology. The clumsy, fragile light pen has been
replaced by mouse, the tablet, touch panel, digitizers and other
devices. Interaction to computer using devices require no knowledge of
programming and only a little keyboard use; the use makes choices by
selecting menus, icons , check options, places predefined symbols on
screen and draws by indicating consecutive end points to be connected by
lines or interpolated by smooth curves and fills closed areas bounded by
polygons or point contours with shades of gray, colors on various
patterns. Now computer graphics have become integral and infamous
technology in the computers system.

**Application of computer graphics:**

Computer graphics started with the display of data or hard copy plotter
and CRT screens had grown include the creation, storage and manipulation
of mode is of images of objects. These models come from a diverse set of
fields and include physical mathematical, engineering , architectural,
natural phenomena and so on. There is virtually no area in which
graphical displays cannot be used to some advantages.

Today al most all application programs even for manipulating text or
numerical data uses graphics extensively in user interface for
visualizing and manipulating the application specific objects. Graphical
interaction has replaced textual interaction with alphanumeric terminal.
Even people who do not use computer encounter computer graphics in TV
commercial or special effects. It is an integral part of all computer
user interfaces and is indepensible for visualizing 2D, 3D and higher-
dimensional objects. We find computer graphics used in a diverse areas
as science, engineering , medicine business, industry, government, art,
entertainment , education and others.

**COMPUTER AIDED DESING (CAD):**

In CAD, interactive graphics is used to design components and systems of
mechanical, electrical, electromechanical and electronic devices
including structures such as buildings, automobile bodies, airplane,
VLSI chips, optical systems and telephone and computer networks. The
emphasis is on interacting with a computer-based model of the component
or

> ***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

system being designed in order to test, for example its structural,
electrical or thermal properties. The model is interpreted by a
simulator that feeds back the behavior of system to the user for further
interactive design and test cycles.

Some mechanical parts are manufactured by describing how the surfaces
are to be formed with machine tools. Numerically controlled machine
tools are then set up to manufacture the parts according to these
construction layouts.

Architects are interactive graphics method to layout floor plans that
shows positioning of rooms, doors, windows, stairs, shelves and other
building features. An electrical designer then try out arrangements for
wiring, electrical outlets and other system to determine space
utilization on a building. The realistic displays then allows architects
and their clients to study appearance of building and even go for a
simulated "walk" through rooms or around building.

**PRESENTATION GRAPHICS:**

Another major application areas of computer graphics is the
"Presentation Graphics". Presentation Graphics are used to provide
illustrations for reports or to generate transparencies for use with
graphics.

Presentation Graphics is commonly used to summarize financial,
statistical, mathematical, scientific and economic data for research
reports, managerial reports and other types of reports. Typical examples
are bar charts, line graphs, surface graphs, pie charts and other
displays showing relationship between multiple variables.

The 3D graphics are usually used simply for effects, they can provide a
more digramatic or more attractive presentation of data relationship.

**Computer Art:**

Computer graphics is used to generate arts. They are widely used in both
fine art and commercial art applications. Fine arts is drawn by artist
hand and this kind of art is perfect to the artist skill. Artist use a
variety of computer methods including special-purpose hardware, artists
paints brush program, other paint packages, specially developed
software. Mathematics packages, CAD packages, desktop publishing
software and animation packages providing facilities.

Moreover, artists uses a touchpad or a stylus or digitizer to draw
pictures. The movement of object is captured by some input hardware.
These arts are usually generated by using mathematical functions or
algorithms.

Computer art is not as realistic as fine arts. Mostly the commercial art
is used to produce animations to demonstrate or present commercial
products to the public. Find artists uses a variety of computer
techniques to produce images. These images are created using a
combination of 3D modeling package, texture mapping, drawing programs
and CAD software.

These technique for generating electronic images are also applied in
commercial art for logos and other design, page layouts combining text
and graphics, TV advertising sports, and other areas. Animations are
also used frequently in advertising and TV commercial and produce frame
by frame, where each frame of the motion is rendered and saved as an
image file.

A common graphics method exployed in many commercials is morphing, where
one object is transformed into another.

**Education and training:**

Computer graphics is used in education and training for making it more
effective and more illustrative. E.g if a teacher is to teach bonding of
molecules or electron jump form higher energy state to lower energy
state or the structure of gene. Then he can demonstrate these concepts
using computer graphics software or presentations.

Another example could be taken for surgery. A student can learn surgery
using data gloves and realistic computer graphics. This way the cost of
education will be low and risk of human life as well. Other examples
could be flight simulator and driving simulator for pilot and driving
training.

Modes of physical systems, physiological systems, population trends or
equipments such as the color coded diagram helping trainees to
understand the operation of the system.

**Entertainment:** Computer graphics methods are new commonly used in
making motion pictures, music videos and TV shows. Images are drawn in
wire-frame form and will be shaded with rendering methods to produce
solid surfaces. Music videos use graphics in several ways. Graphics
objects can be combined with the line action.

Computer graphics are also used to introduce virtual characters to
movies like character in "Lord of the Rings".

**Visualization:** Some methods generate very large amount of
data/information for example a survey of one lakh people's choice for
using different toothpaste generates large amount of data. Analysing the
property of the whole amount of data. Analysing the property of the
whole amount of data is very difficult. If we try to locate each and
every data value. Therefore

to visualize large amount of information graphical computer systems are
used.

**Image Processing:** Image can be created using simple point program or
can be fed into computer by scanning the image. These picture/ images
need to be changed to improve the quality.

Form image/pattern recognition systems, images need to be changed in
specified format so that the system can recognize the meaning of the
picture. For example scanners with OCR features must have letters
similar to standard font set.

**Graphical user Interface:** GUIs have become key factors for the
success of the software or operating system. GUI uses graphical objects
called gizmos to represent certain objects or process involved in human
computer communication for virtual purpose. Lots of aesthetics (colors)
and psychological analysis have been done to create user friendly GUI.
The most popular GUI is windows based GUI. The GUI creators are putting
having emphasis on 3D GUI creation.

**2.0 HARDWARE CONCEPT:** Input device are used to feed data or
information into a computer system. They are usually used to provide
input to the computer upon which reaction, outputs are generated. Data
input devices like keyboards are used to provide additional data to the
computers whereas pointing and selection devices like mouse , light
pens, touch panels are used to provide visual and indication-input to
the application.

**Keyboard:** Keyboard is a primary serial input device. For each key
press, a keyboard senses specific codes(American standard code for
Information Interchange, ASCII) to the computes. Keyboards are also
capable of sending/coding combinations of key press and special keys
like function keys. The coding for the combination of key pressing is
called "chording". It is useful for expert users in giving exact
commands to the computer. Cursor-controlled keys and function keys are
used for doing operations in a single keystroke.

Other types of cursor-pointer devices are trackball or joystick. A
numeric keypad is after included on the keyboard for fast entry of
numeric data.

Several different technologies are used to detect a key depression
including mechanical contact closure, change in capacitance and magnetic
coupling. Chording is not possible with standard "coded keyboard", which
returns only an ASCII code per keystrokes and returns nothing if two
keys are pressed simultaneously. An unencoded keyboard can identify of
all key press simultaneously allowing chording.

**Mouse (Mechanical and optical):** Mouse is a serial input device used
to select object movement in graphics system. It converts horizontal
movement into vertical movement. Primary principle of curser movement is
to detect the amount of displacement of mouse in horizontal plane. This
displacement is mapped into screen. Generally the mapping ratio is 1:8 .
According to their working mechanism tow types of mouse are there. They
are:

-   Mechanical mouse and

-   Optical Mouse.

6

Mechanical mouse contains two rollers. One rollers count horizontal
displacement and another roller counts vertical displacement. The motion
of the roller in the base of mechanical mouse is converted to digital
values that are used to determine the direction and magnetic of
movement.

Optical mouse uses a special mouse pad with a matrix of Black and white
grid of lines. The matrix reflects light from the LED on the bottom of
the mouse. The intensity/quality of reflected light varies as Black and
white lines reflects it alternatively. The alternate reflections are
used to calculate the relative position change.

**Advantages:**

-   None of the part of computer screen is obscure (hidden from head).

-   Movement becomes easier as had rests at a desk for movement.

-   Direct-point- and --click.

-   Easy to use and understand.

**Light Pens:** Light pens are pencil shaped devices used to select
screen positions by detecting the light coming from points on the CRT
screen. They are sensitive to the short burst of light emitted from the
phosphor coating as the instant electron beam strikes a particular
point. Other light sources , such as background light in the room are
usually not detected by a light pen.

An activated light pen pointed at a spot on the screen as the electron
beam light. Some of that spot generates an electrical pulse that causes
the co-ordinate position of the electron beam to be recorded.

***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

> **Disadvantages:**

-   When used for long time, leads to an arm pain.

-   Some part of the screen will be obscure by hand.

-   Cannot read black pixel position.

-   Reading might be errorous if background light has very high
    > intensity.

**Touch-Panel:** Touch panels are a sensitive surface that is used to
point directly. The panel can be touched by finger or any other object
like stylus Transparent touch panels are integrated with computer
monitor for the manipulation of information display.

A basic touch panel senses voltage drop when a user touches the panel.
It knows where the voltage has dropped and accordingly calculates the
touch position.

> \- Resistant based touch panel uses two substances of glass or plastic
> separates by insulators. When a user touches the panel these two
> substances are connected and the resistance at that point will drop
> down. The resistance drop is sensed and the touch position is
> calculated.
>
> \- In capacitance based touch panel, some charge is spread on the
> screen. When user touches the panel the charge is drawn by finger form
> each side proportionally. The sensor calculates the charge in
> frequency of charge/voltage and find out the touch position.
>
> \- In Acoustic(Sound) based touch panel uses very high frequency (5

-   An optical touch panel uses Infra red (IR) emitters and sensor on X
    > and Y-axis sides, emitter are placed and on the apposite sides
    > sensors are placed when a user touches the screen, the point will
    > interrupt two IR beam from X and y-axis. This is detected by IR
    > sensors and the touch position is calculated.

**Advantages:**

-   Touch panel can be mounted an display screen leaving more space on
    > desktop but mouse, joystick etc. take some space.

**Tablets (Electronic, Sonic and Resistive ):** A common device for
drawing, painting or interactively selecting co-ordinate position on an
object is a digitizer. Typically a digitizer is used to scan over a
drawing on object and to input a set of discrete co-ordinate position
which can be joined with straight line segments to approximate the curve
surface shape.

One type of digitizer is Graphics tablets (data tablets), which is used
to input two dimensional (2D) co-ordinate by activity a hand curser or
stylus as selected position, flat surface. A had curser contains cross
hairs for sighting position, while a stylus is a pencil shaped device
that is pointed to the position of the tablet. Many graphics tablets are
constructed with a rectangular grid of wires embedded on the tablet
surface. Electromagnetic pulses are generated in sequence along the
wires and an electric signal is induced in a wire coil. In an activated
stylus or hand curser to record tablet position.

Acoustic (Sonic) tablets use sound waves to detect a stylus position.
Either strip microphones or point microphones are used to detect the
sound emitted by an electrical spark from a stylus tip. The position of
the stylus is calculated by calculating the arrival time of generated
sound at different microphone position.

-   Graphics commands in the application program are translated by the
    graphic package in to a display file stored in the system memory.

-   This display file is then accessed by the display processor to
    refresh the screen.

-   Sometimes the display processor in a random scan is referred to as a
    display processing unit or a graphics controller.

-   The buffer stores the computer produce display list or display
    program which contains points and line plotting commands with (x,y)
    and end point co-ordinates as well as character plotting commands.

-   The commands for plotting points lines and characters are
    interpreted by the display processor.

-   It sends digital and points co-ordinates to a vector generator that
    > converts digital co-ordinates values to analog voltages for beam
    > deflection circuits that display an electron beam writing on CRT
    > phosphor coating.

-   The main principal of the vector system is that the beam is
    > deflected form end point to end point as detected by arbitrary
    > order of the display commands term as random scan.

-   Since the light out put of phosphor decays in tens or hundreds of

    > above in refresh buffer is to provide cyclic refresh.

-   A CRT beam in this system is adjusted in such a way that electron
    > beam only hits the spot where the graphics is to be drawn.

**Disadvantages:**

-   When the number of command in the buffer goes high the system take

Frame buffer

> **Fig.** Basic video controller Refresh operation.

-   Two register are used to store the co-ordinates of the screen pixel.

-   Initially the X register is set 0 and Y register is set to y~max~ .

-   The value stored in the frame buffer for this pixel position is then
    retrieved and then used to set the intensity of CRT beam.

> ***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

-   Then the x register is increased by one and process repeated for the
    next pixel in the top scan line.

-   This process is repeated for each pixel along line.

-   When the last pixel of the top scan line has been processed the x
    register is reset to zero and y register is decremented by 1 pixels
    on the screen lines are processed against inturn; and the process is
    repeated for each successive scan line.

-   After cycling though each pixel along the bottom scan line (y =0)
    the video controller resets the register the first pixel poison on
    the top scan line and refresh process starts over.

-   Screen must be refresh at least at the rate of 60 frames per second.

-   To speed of the pixel processing video controller can retrieve
    multiple pixel values from the refresh buffer on each pass. The
    multiple pixel intensity are then stored in a separate register and
    used to controlled the CRT bit intensity for a group of adjacent
    pixel. When that group of pixel has been processes the next block of
    pixel values is retrieved from the frame buffer.

-   Besides these refresh operation video controller also performs
    different operation video controller retrieved pixel intensity from
    different memory area on different refresh cycle.

-   In high quality system, for example , two frame buffers are often
    provided so that gun buffer can be used for refreshing while the
    other is being filled with intensity values.

-   This provides a fast mechanism for generating real time animations
    seans different views of moving object can be successively loaded in
    the refresh buffer.

The frame buffer contain the displayable image created by the scan
conversion and raster operation.

-   It has also a separate display processor or memory area in addition
    > to system memory.

-   The major task of display processor is digitizing a picture
    > definition given in an application program into a set of pixel
    > intensity values for storage in the frame buffer.

-   This process is called scan conversion.

-   Graphic commands specifying straight line and another geometric
    > objects are scan converted into a set of discrete intensity point.

-   Can converting a straight line sequence means that we have to locate
    > the pixel position close to the line path and store the intensity
    > for each position in a frame buffer.

-   Similar methods are used for scan converting curved lines and
    > polygon outlines.

-   Character can be defined with rectangular grids or they can be
    > defined as curved outlines.

-   The array size of character grids can vary from about 5 by 7 to 9 by
    > 12 or more for high quality display.

-   Character grid is display by superimposing the rectangular grid
    > pattern into the frame buffer at a specified co-ordinate position.

-   Display processor is also design to perform the number of additional
    > operation.

-   It is used for various liens style (Dashed, dotted or solid),
    > displaying color areas and perform certain transformation and
    > manipulation on displayed objects.

**Comparison between raster and vector graphics:**

13

1.  Since the picture definition is stored as the set of line-drawing
    instructions and not as a set of intensity values foe all screen
    points, vector displays generally have higher resolution than raster
    systems. For these reasons, random-scan systems are designed for
    line-drawing applications and cannot display realistic shaded
    scenes. Moreover, vector displays produce smooth line drawings
    because CRT beam directly follows a line path but raster system in
    contrast produces jagged lines that are plotted as a discrete point
    sets.

> Figure below illustrates this:

random scan system, whose vector generators must be highly accurate to
provide linearity and repeatability of beam's deflection.

3.  One major advantages of raster graphics over vector graphics
    includes the ability to display areas filled with solid colors or
    patterns. Moreover, the refresh process is independent of complexity
    (i.e. no. of lines) of image and each pixel in buffer can be read
    out on each refresh cycles, allowing flicker free display.

4.  Major disadvantage of raster system compared to vector system is the
    discrete nature of the pixel representation. This happens due to
    scan-conversion of end points (vertices) into their component pixels
    in frame buffer. This can be shown in figure below:

![](media/image27.png){width="1.56875in" height="1.7756944444444445in"}

5.  Another drawback of raster system arises from the nature of raster
    itself. A vector system can draw continuous, smooth line (curves)
    from any point on the CRT face to other, the raster system displays
    these lines (curves) mathematically using

> various algorithms causing problems of "jaggering" or "staircasing".

that electron beam only hits the spots where picture is to be drawn. Two
phosphorus layer (Red and green) are adjusted such that outer layer
should red and inner layer should be green. The color picture depends on
how far the electron beam penetrates. The slow electron beam only excite
outer red layer. The high speed electron beam excite inner green layer.
At the intermediate speed, the combination of red and green lights are
emitted to show two additional colors orange or yellow.

screen shadow mask grid is placed whose number is same as a number of
pixel. Three electron gun is adjusted for each phosphorous. The electron
beams is detected and focus on the shadow mask hole. The Passed from the
hole activate the dot triangle and produce the color spot on the screen.
The color of pixel is controlled by light of intensity. By combing three
color, 17 million color can be obtained. For true color each pixel has
24 bits in the frame buffer.

> b = y -- mx ................(iii)

For any given x-interval △x along the line, we compute the corresponding
y- intercept △y form equation (ii).

> △y = m △x .....................(iv)
>
> △x = ~∆~*^m^~y~*

These equations form the basis of determining deflection voltage in
analog devices.

**Case: I**

For *m* \< 1,

Then △x can be proportional to a small horizontal deflection

voltage and the corresponding vertical deflection is set to △y as
calculated from equation (iv).

**Case: II**

For *m* \>1

Then, △y can be set proportional to a small vertical deflection voltage
with the corresponding horizontal voltage set

proportional to △x calculated from equation (V)

Case III

When *m* = 1, then △x = △y and then horizontal and vertical voltages
equal.

**Comments:**

1.  It uses multiplication

2.  It uses float operation.

**DDA ( Digital differential Analyzer):**

This algorithm samples the line at unit interval in one-coordinate

and determines corresponding integer values nearest the line path

for other co-ordinates.

The equation of the line is,

> Y = mx+b......................(i)
>
> m = y~2~-y~1~/x~2~-x~1~ ....................(ii)

For any interval △x , corresponding interval is given by △y = m △x.

**Case I :**

m.  \< 1 , we sample at unit x interval i.e △x = 1.

> X~k+1~ = x~k~+1 .................(iii)

Then we compute each successive y-values,

> △y = m
>
> Y~k+1~ = y~k~ + m ..........................(iv)

Case: II

m.  \> 1, we sample at unit y-interval i.e △y = 1 and compute each
    successive x-values.

Therefore, 1 = m △x

> △x = 1/m
>
> X~k+1~- x~k~ = 1/m.................(v)

Y~k+1+~ = y~k~ + 1................(vi)

Above equation hold for the lines processed from left end to right end.
For the reverse process i. e if the line is to be processed form right
to left then,

> ***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

For *m* \<1, △x = -1

X~k+1~ = x~k~-1

Y~k+1~ = y~k~ +m

For *m* \>1, △y = -1

> Yk+1 =y=k +1 ........................(ix)

X~k+1~= x~k~ +1/m................(x)

Therefore , in general,

Y~k+1~ = y ± m

x~k+1~ = x~k~ ± 1 for *m* \< 0

y~k+1~= y~k~ ± 1

x~k+1~ = x~k~ ± 1/m for *m* \>0

*Eg. **Example:** Digitize a line with end points (10,15) and (15, 30).*

Solution:

> The slope of line is

Bresenhan's Algorithm selects the best pixel co-ordinate by

testing the sing of an integer parameter whose value is

proportional to the difference between the separation of two

P~x~ = 2. (△y/△x).x~k~ △x -2y~k~ △x +( 2m+2b-1)

P ~x~ = 2 △y x~k~ -- 2 △x y~k~ +c

Where, C = (2m+2b-1) △x is a constant.

Now, for next step,

P~k+1~ = 2 △x x~k+1~ -- 2 △x y~k+1~ +c.............(ii)

From (i) and (ii)

P~k+1~ -- P~k~ = 2 △y (x~k+1~- x~k~) -- 2 △x ( y~k+1~- y~k~)

i.e p~k+1~ = p~k~ +2 △y -- 2 △x ( y~k+1~ --y~k~)

Where,

> Y~k+1~ -- y~k~ = 'o' or '1'

If p~k~\< 0 , then we plot lower pixel

Y~k+1~ = y~k~ ..................(iii)

P~k+1~ = p~k~ +2 △y .............(iv)

If p~k~ ≥ 0 then we plot upper pixel.

When, h = 0, x = 0 then the equation of the circle at origin x^2^+y^2^ =
r^2^ ...............(ii)

Differentiating both sides,

> 2x+2y dy/dx = 0

Or dy/dx = -x/y , where , dy/dx = slope

Now , if dy/dx = 0, then x = 0.

If, dy/dx = -1, then x = y

using incremental calculation. We obtained a recursive expression for
the next decision parameter by evaluation the circle function at
sampling position.

X~k+1~ +1 = x~k~ +2

Pk+1 = fcircle (xk+1+1 ,yk+1 -- ½)

For initial decision parameter.

> (x~0~,y~0~) = (0,r)

Hence , P~0~ = f(x~0~+1, y~o~- ½)

-   f( 1, r-1/2)

-   1+ (r-1/2)^2^ --r^2^

-   1 + r^2^ -- r + 1/4 -- r^2^

> = (x~k+1~+1)^2^ + ( y~k+1~-1/2)^2^ -- r^2^ ..................(v)

> Substituting equation (iv) from (v).

P~k+1~ -- p~k~ = (x~k+1~ + 1 )^2^ + (y~k+1~- ½)^2^ -- (x~k~ +1)^2^-
(y~k~- ½ )^2^ ....(VI)

P~o~ = 5/4 -- r

P~o~ = 1-r

P = 1-r ..........(ix) since 5 and 4 are integer values so can be

rendered off.

If p~k~ ≥ 0 , the mid position lies on outside the circle hence, x~k+1~
=

x~k~+1, y~k+1~ = y~k~ -1;

Now from equation (vi)

x~k+1~ = x~k~ +1

P~k+1~ = p~k~ + (x~k~ + 1+1)^2^ + (y~k~-1-1/2)^2^ -- (x~k~+1)^2^ --
(y~k~ -- ½ )^2^

= p~k~+(x~k~ + 1)+ 2(x~k~+1). 1 + 1 + (y~k~ -1/2)^2^ -2 ( y~k~ -1/2).1 +
1 -- (x~k~ +1)^2^ -- (y~k~-1/2)^2^

P~k+1~ = p~k~ + 2(x~k+1~- y~k+1~)+1.............(vii)

Where x~k+1~ = x~k~ +1, y~k+1~ = y~k~ -- 1;

If p~k~ \< 0, the midpoint lies inside the circle, X~k+1~ = x~k~ + 1,
y~k+1~ = y~k~

Substituting the value in equation (vi)

> P~k+1~ = p~k~ + (x~k+1~ +1 )^2^ + (y~k~ -- ½)^2^ -- (x~k~+1)^2^ --
> (y~k~ -- ½)^2^

-   P~k~ + (x~k~+1)^2^ + 2(x~k+1~).1. + 1 -- (x~k~ +1)^2^

    -   P~k~ + 2(x~k+1~)+1

> **Algorithm:**

1.  Get the input centre (x~c~, y~c~) and radius of the circle.

2.  Set x = 0, and y = r.

3.  Plot the first point and its symmetry at appropriate positions by x
    > = x+x~c~ , y = y + y~c~

4.  Compute the initial decision parameter. P = 1- r

5.  Repeat the following till x \< y.

    i.  Set x = x+1.

    ii. Check if P\< 0 then.

> Let us define an ellipse function centered at origin by f(x, y)=
> b^2^x^2^ + a^2^y^2^ -- a^2^b^2^ .
>
> If f(x,y) \< 0 , the point lies inside the ellipse.

-   0, the point lies on the ellipse.

    -   0, the point lies outside the ellipse.

Starting at ( 0,b) we take unit steps in x -direction until we reach the
boundary between region 1 region 2 ( R~1~ , R~2~ ) . Then we switch to
unit steps in y-direction over the remainder of curve in first quadrant.
At each step, we need to test the value of the slope of the curve .The
ellipse slope is calculated from equation :

> x^2^/a^2^ +y^2^/b^2^ = 1

Differentiating both sides w.r to x

> 2x/a^2^ + 2y/b^2^. dy/dx = 0
>
> Dy/dx = -2b^2^x/2a^2^y
>
> At the boundary region 1 and region 2 , dy/dx = -1 and 2b^2^x=
> 2a^2^y..

Therefore , we move out of region 1 (R~1~) when 2b^2^x ≥ 2a^2^y. **For**
**region R~1~.**

> b^2^x^2^+a^2^y^2^-a^2^b^2^ = 0

This algorithm is used to display the ellipse in standard form. The
algorithm is applied throughout the 1^st^ quadrant according to the
slope of the ellipse. For the region (R~1~) where the slope of the curve
is less then one. We process by taking unit steps in x-direction and for
the region (R~2~) we take unit steps in y-

direction. ~28~

**About origin:** If p(x,y) is rotated to a new position p'(x',y') in
anti-clockwise direction by an angle θ , then (x',y') can be calculated
as following.

Let the angle made by line OP with x-axis is α and the radius of
circulation path is r then,

x.  = r cosα y = r sinα Also,

x' = r cos(θ +α ) y' = r sin( θ + α )

x' = r(cosθ. Cosα -- sinθ. Sinα )

x' = xcosθ -- y sinθ

y' = r( sin θ. Cosα + cos θ .sinα)

**Inverse Transformation:**

For inverse translation:

T^-1^ (t~x~,t~y~ )= T ( -t~x~ , -t~y~ )

For inverse Rotation:

R^-1^(θ =R(-θ)

For inverse scaling:

s^-1^(s~x~,s~y~) = S(1/s~x~, 1/s~y~)

-   Prove that two successive translations are additive. i.e T(t~x~,
    t~y~). T(t~x2~,t~y2~) = T(t~x1~ +t~x2~, t~y1~ +t~y2~).

Solution:

> Let p be the point translated by T(t~x1~,t~y1~) to point p' then, P' =
> T (t~x1~,t~y1~). P
>
> Let p' be the point translated by T(t~x2~,t~y2~) to point p'' then,
> P'' = T (t~x2~, t~y2~). P'
>
> = T (t~x2~,t~y2~).T (t~x1~,t~y1~).p
>
> Net transformation = T(t~x2~,t~y2~). T (t~x1~,t~y1~)

**Alternative way for reflection:**

Step:1

Rotate the object so that y axis concise x-axis. i.e R(-90) Step: 2

Reflection about x-axis. R~fx~

Step: 3

Rotate back the object so that y-axis move to original position . R(-90)

Net transformation:

> i.e R~fy~ = R(90) . R~fx~. R(-90)

The value 1 indicates its relative position. If a point is within
clipping rectangle then region code is 0000. So , If x -- x~wmin~ \< 0 ,
b ~1~ = 1

If x~wmax~ -- x \< 0 , b~2~ = 1

If y -- y~wmin~ \< 0 , b~3~ = 1

If y~wmin~ -- y \< 0 , b~4~ = 1

If the region codes of both end points are 0000 then we accept the line.

> Any line that have one in the same bit position is rejected i.e

if R~A~ AND R~B~ ≠ 0

> Line is completely outside .

P~1~ANDP~2~=0

So we need future calculation.

Starting form p~1~,

Intersection of P~1~ with left boundary is calculated.

> Region code of P~1~' = 0000

P~1~'ANDP~2~=0.

Intersecting of P~2~ with above boundary is calculated region code of
p~2~' = 0000

Since both end points have region codes (0000) .So P~1~', P~2~' portion
of the line is saved.

> Similarly,
>
> For P~3~ , P~4.~

P~3~ = 1000

P~4~ = 0010

P~3~ANDP~4~=0

So we need further calculations; starting form P~3~ region code of P~3~
is 1000, i.e b~4~ is high, so intersection of P~3~ with upper boundary
which yields P~3~' having region code 0010.

> Again p~3~' AND P~4~ ≠ 0

So P~3~P~4~ is totally clipped.

The intersection point with vertical boundary can be obtained by y =
y~1~ + m(x-x ~1~)

**Two dimensional object to screen viewing Transformation:**

**Mechanism for displaying view of a picture on an output device:**

view areas are selected, these areas can be placed in separate display
locations or some areas could be inserted into other, larger display
area. Transformations from world to device co-ordinates involve
translation rotation and scaling operations, as well as procedures for
deleting those parts of the picture that are outside the limits of a
selected display area.

A world co-ordinate area selected for display is called a window. An
area on the display device to which a window is mapped is called a view
port. The window defines what is to be viewed. The viewport defines
where it is to be displayed.

Often, windows and viewports are rectangles in standard positions, if
the rectangle edges are parallel to the co-ordinate axis.

" The mapping of a port of a world co-ordinate scene to a device
co-ordinates is referred to as viewing transformation." Sometimes , the
2D viewing transformation is simply referred to as the window -- to --
viewport transformation or the windowing transformation.

Fig. given below illustrates the mapping of a picture selections that
falls within a rectangular window onto a designated rectangular
viewpoint.

A graphical package allows a user to specify which part of the defined
picture is to be displayed and where that part is to be placed on the
display device. Any convenient Cartesian co-ordinate system; referred to
as the world co ordinate reference frame can be used to define the
picture.

For a 2-D picture, a view is selected by specifying a subarea of the
total picture area. A user can select single area for displaying or
several areas could be selected for simultaneous display. The picture
parts within the selected areas are then mapped onto specified areas of
the device co-ordinates. When the multiple

Fig. A viewing transformation using standard rectangles for the window
and viewpoint.

Steps to be followed for window to viewpoint transformations area:

-   Generate world co-ordinate

-   Convert world co-ordinate to view co-ordinate.

-   Map the view co-ordinate to normalized viewing co-ordinate.

-   Map the normalized viewing co-ordinate to device co-ordinate system.

These steps can be illustrated through a pipeline.

Fig. The two dimensional viewing transformation pipeline

By changing the position of the viewport we can view objects at
different positions on the display area of an output device. Also by
varying size of the viewport we can change the size and proportions of
displayed objects.

It is the mechanism for displaying view of a picture on an output
device. The world co-ordinate selected for display is called window. The
area on the display device to which window is mapped is called viewport.
So, window defines what is to be viewport defines where it is to be
displayed. The mapping of part of world co-ordinate scence to device
co-ordinate is called viewing transformation or window-to-viewport
transformation.

Window -- to -- viewport transformation can be explained as:

-   Choose the world co-ordinate in a rectangle.

-   Transform it to origin.

-   Scale it with appropriate value.

-   Transform it to the relative position in viewport.

Step 1: T (-x~wmin~, -y~wmin~)

Step:2: S (s~x~, s~y~)

Step:3: T(x~vmin~, y~vmin~)

-   Net transformation,

T~wv~ = T (x~vmin~, y~vmin~). S(s~x~, s~y~).T(-x~wmin~, -y~wmin~)

> The value of s~x~ and s~y~ is found by calculating the position of
> (x,y) in the window to the corresponding position of point (u,v) in
> the viewpoint.

> To maintain the same relative position, so

**Data Structural Concept:**

**Introduction:**

Data may be organized in different ways; the logical or mathematical
model of a particular organization of data is called data structure. In
other words, data structure is a collection of data elements whose
organization is characterized by accessing operations that are used to
store and retrieve individual data elements.

Data structure is of two types:

1.  Linear data structure. E.g Array, stack, Queue etc.

2.  Non linear data structure. E.g Trees.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(i) **Array:** An array is collection of similar elements all elements
    of any given array must be of the same type.

  --- --- --- --- --- ------------------------------ -- -----
  1   2   3   4   5   \...\...\...\...\...\...\...      100
                                                        
  --- --- --- --- --- ------------------------------ -- -----

> Fig. Array of 100 students

(ii) **Stack:** A stack is defined formally as a list (a linear data
     structure) in which all insertion and deletions are made at one end
     called the top of the stack(TOS). The fundamental operations which
     are possible on a stack are:

     -   push - insertion

     -   pop - deletion

     -   peep -- extract information

48

-   Update -- Update information associated at some location in the
    > stack.

The most recently pushed element can be checked prior to performing a
pop operation.

A stack is based on the last in first out algorithm (LIFO) in which
insertion and deletion operations are performed at one end of the stack.
The most accessible information in a stack is at the top of the stack
and least accessible information is at the bottom of the stack.

If someone wants to delete on item from an empty stack, it causes
underflow and if someone wants to add an element to the stack (which is
already full) then it is the case of overflow.

A.  Top of the stack

> B C

+---+-----------------------+
| D | > Bottom of the stack |
+---+-----------------------+

**Implementation of Stack:**

Stack can be implemented in two ways:

1.  pointer (Linked list)

2.  Array

**Push operation:**

Step 1: Check for the overflow

> If TOS ≥ = size
>
> Output: "stack overflow and exit".

Step 2: Increment the pointer value by one

> TOS = TOS +1

Step 3: Perform insertion

> ***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

***[Downloaded from www.jayaram.com.np]{.ul}***

> S\[TOS\] = value

Step 4: Exit

**POP operation:**

> Step 1: Check for the underflow
>
> If TOS = 0
>
> Output: "Stack underflow and exit"
>
> Step 2: Decrement the pointer value by one Value = S\[TOS\]
>
> TOS = TOS-1
>
> Step 3: Return the former information of the stack Return \[value\]

Step 4: Exit.

**PEEP operation:** If one interested only about an information stored
at some location in a stack, then peep operation is required. In this
operation we simply move the pointer to the desired location and then
fetch the information associated with the location.

Step 1: \[ Check for the stack underflow\]

> If TOS-i+1 \< 0
>
> Output : " Stack underflow" and exit.

Step 2: \[Return the i^th^ element from the top of the stack\]
Return\[S(TOS --i+1)\]

Step 1: \[Check for underflow\]

> If TOS-i+1\<0
>
> Output "stack underflow" and exit.

Step 2: \[Change the element\]

> S(TOS-i+1) = value

Step 3: Return

**Polish Notation:** The process of writing the operator of an
expression either before their operands or after them is called the
polish notation in honor of its discover, the "Polish mathematician Jan
Luksiewicz.".

> The polish notations are classified into three categories:

these are:

-   Infix

-   Postfix

-   Prefix

For example, take an expression a+b, for infix +sign is placed between
two operands 'a+b'. For postfix, we can write the same expression as
'ab+' i.e operator is placed after the operands. For prefix the same
expression can be written as +ab.

> *Date: 2065/6/8*

**Update Operation:** It is required when the content of some location
in a stack is to be changed. Suppose one wants to update information at
the i^th^ location in the stack 's'. We move TOS pointer to the i^th^
location from the top of the stack and input the new value of that
location.

**Queue:**

+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------------+---+
| Deletion | 9 | 5 | 4 | 2 |   |   | > insertion |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------------+---+
| > Front  |   |   |   |   |   |   | > Rear      |   |

This is a linear data structure used to represent a linear list and
permits deletion to be performed at one end of the list and insertion on
the other end of the list. The information is such a list is processed
in the same order as it was received, i.e on first come first serve
basis.(FCFS)

A queue has two pointes; front and rear , pointing to the front and rear
elements of the queue respectively. Consider a queue consisting of 'n'
elements and an element value which we have to insert into the queue.
The value NULL (0) of front pointer employees an empty queue. Figure
given above illustrates a queue.

c.  Inset a node between the nodes.

(2) Deletion

    a.  Delete a node at the beginning of the list.

    b.  Delete a node at the end of the list.

    c.  Delete a node between the nodes.

(3) Traversing . : Traveling from one node to another node.

**Doubly linked list:**

A singly linked list is so named because each list element contain a
pointer to the next element . In that list traveling is possible only in
one direction. Some times it is required to transverse the list in
either direction forward or backward. This involves the performance and
efficiency of algorithms. So traversing of linked list in both the
directions requires nodes having the links as given in figure below:

+-------------+---------------+---+
|             | > information |   |
+-------------+---------------+---+
| right link  |               |   |
+-------------+---------------+---+
|             | > right link  |   |
+-------------+---------------+---+
| > left link | > left link   |   |
+-------------+---------------+---+
|             |               |   |
+-------------+---------------+---+

in the figure above. Now it is possible to define a doubly linked as a
collection of nodes, each nodes having three fields.

-   pointer to previous node ( pointer to predecessor)

-   Information field

-   Pointer to next node (pointer to successor) Different operations
    performed on doubly linked list are:

1\. Insertion 2. Deletion 3. Traversing.

subtrees of a node is called its degree, root N1, has degree 3.
Similarly node N5 has degree 5 and node N14 has degree 0. A

node with degree 0 is called leaf. N6,N7,N8,N9,N10,N11,N12,......N18 are
called leaf nodes. The

leaf nodes are also called Terminal nodes and rest of nodes in a tree is
called non-terminal.

right successor of R.

A forest is a set of n ≥ 0 disjoint trees, where n represents no of
nodes in the tree. The meaning of forest is very close to a tree because
if we remove the root of a tree, we get a forest. For e.g in the fig.
above we remove N1, we get the forest of three trees. It is shown in the
figure above.

**Binary tree:**

A binary tree T is a finite set of nodes, which is either empty or
consists of special nodes called R and two disjoint binary tree T1 and
T2 (Which are called the left subtree and right subtree respectively).
If T1 is not empty then the root of T1 is called the

2.  **Graphs:** graphs G is defined as set of two tuples G = (V,E).
    Where ,

V represents set of vertices of G and E represents the set of edges of
G. There exists a mapping from the set of edges to a set of pairs of
element of V. Fog eg. given below shows the different types of graphs.

From the figure it is clear that fig. (a) consists of two vertices each
one is stand alone. Fig (b) contains an undirected graph having one edge
and two vertices. Fig. (c) consists of two vertices and one edge and it
is called directed graph. Fig. (d) illustrates an undirected graph with
six vertices and nine edges. Fig (e) is a directed graph with five
vertices and seven edges. Fig (f) consists of three vertices and four
edged in which two edges are directed and two are undirected known as
mixed graph.

**Path:** A sequence of edges of a digraph (directed graph) such that
the terminal vertex of an edge sequence in the initial vertex of the
next if exits is called the path. For example:

E = {(v1,v2), (v2,v3), (v3,v4),(v4,v5),(v5,v1)}

If we consider the element of E, we find that E is a set of five

tuples, i.e for edge.

e~1~ = (v1,v2)

e~2~ = (v2,v3)

e~3~ = (v3,v4)

e~4~ = (v4,v5)

e~5~ = (v5,v1)

From e~1~ and e~2~ we find that v~2~ is common in both. In the e~1~ , v2
is the terminal vertex and it is initial vertex of e~2~. Similarly in
e~2~ and e~3~ , v3 is corner and so on. Thus we can say that there is
cycle and there exist a circular path that is shown by the dark line in
the above fig.

The 3D viewing process is inherently more complex then is the 2D viewing
process. In 2D we simply specify specify the window on 2D world and a
viewpoint on the 2D-view surface. Conceptually objects in the world are
clipped against the window and are then transformed into the viewpoint
for display. The extra complexicity 3D-viewing is caused in the part by
the added dimensions and in part by the fact that display device are
only 2D

The solution is mismatch between 3D object and 2D displays is
accomplished by introducing projections which transforms 3D objects onto
a 2D-projection plane.

In 3D- viewing , we specify a new volume in world a projection onto a
projection plane and a viewport on the view surface. Conceptually
objects in the 3D-new volume and are then projected. The content of the
projection of the new volume onto the projection plane, called the
window, are then displayed (transformed into the view port for display).
Figure below shows the conceptual model of the 3D-viewing process.

**Projections:** Projections transform points in a co-ordinate system of
dimension 'n' into points in a co-ordinate system of dimension less than
'n' projection of 3D-object is defied by straight projection rays
(Called projectors) emanding from a centre of projection, passing
through each point of the object and intersecting a projection plane to
form the projected object. If the projection is onto a plane (rather
than some curved surface) and uses straight objectors (rather then
curved) then we call it planar-geometric projection.

**Types of Geometric Projection:**

1.  Parallel projection

2.  Perpesctive projection.

**Parallel projection:**

If the distance between COP and POP is infinite then projection is
called parallel projection, i.e the rays from COP are paralleled.

So it maintains relative proportion of the object. In this ~56~

But on the xy plane

1.  = z~1~+z~p~u ∴ u = -z~1~/z~p~

x~2~ = x~1~-z~1~(x~p~/z~p~)

y~2~ = y~1~-z~1~(y~p~/z~p~)

However, while drawing the projected image we just ignore the z plane.

(2) **Perspective projection:** If the distance between POP and COP is
    finite and converges to a single point (Vanishing point) then the
    projection is called perspective projection i.e it transforms points
    of 3D object along projection lines that meet at vanishing point.
    The size of the object doesnot remains same and varies with the
    distance of the object from COP. Objects further from viewing
    position is displayed smaller than objects of same size that are
    nearer to viewing

> positions. Perpesctive projection is more realistic than parallel.

If the COP at \[ x~c~,y~c~,z~c~\] and the point on the object is
\[x,y,z\] then projection ray will be the line joining these points.
Equation of the line is

X.  = x~c~+(x~1~-x~c~)u Y = y~c~+(y~1~-y~c~)u Z = z~c~+(z~1~-y~c~)u

The projected point on xy plane i.e (x~2~,y~2~) will be the point where
the line intersects the xy plane.

**Rotation About z-axis:**

> Z-component does not change. The rotation of a point about z-

axis is equivalent to rotation of point projected on xy plane

(keeping z-value constant ) which is equivalent to 2D rotation i.e

rotation angle is equal to the angle between initial and final

projected points on xy-plane

X' = xcosθ -- ysinθ

Y' = xsinθ + ysinθ

(i) For step II rotation can not be performed directly since the
    rotation is not about any of the co-ordinate axis hence. It is done
    in two steps.

    a.  Rotation by angle α about x axis.

    b.  Rotate by angle β about y axis.
